# MPC ECDSA in Web Browser

This is a demonstration of ECDSA distributed key generation and signing protocols in a [secure multi-party computation (MPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multi-party_computation) setting. All computations are done **only** by browser Javascript. This is inspired by *Fast Secure Multiparty ECDSA with Practical Distributed Key Generation and Applications to Cryptocurrency Custody, Y. Lindell et al, 2018*. [eprint](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/987.pdf), [CCS'18](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3243734.3243788), but in a more relaxed security.

## MPC Setting

### Secret Sharing

In this demo, [Shamir Secret Sharing(SSS)]([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir's_Secret_Sharing)) is used for parties to have *shares* without revealing secret information, such as secret key of EC, nonce `k` in signing protocol. A prime field is used for polinomial computations. This is a *k-out-of-n* protocol for any *n* and *k* satisfy *n <= 2k - 1*, where *n* is the total number of parties, and *k* is the number of honest parties.

### Security

This setting assumes *Semi-Honest* security model where all parties are expected to follow the protocols, but some of corrupted parties cooperate to reveal secret information. Therefore, it *should not* be used for real applications. If you need a *Malicious* model, please check the papers.

### Instructions

- Go to [demo page for party1](https://jwata.github.io/mpc-ecdsa/demo.html?party=1), and open [developer console](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console#javascript)  to run Javascript code.
- Open [party2](https://jwata.github.io/mpc-ecdsa/demo.html?party=2), and [party3](https://jwata.github.io/mpc-ecdsa/demo.html?party=3) in different tabs. Now you open 3 tabs.
- Run `demos.ecdsa.party()` on each party's console.
- PublicKey, Message, Signature will show up in the outputs. 
  - Public Key ... EC public key generated by MPC `KeyGen` protocol.
  - Message ... Message of the signature.
  - Signature ... ECDSA signature generated by MPC `Sign` protocol.
- Verify the signatrue using `openssl`.
  - Run `openssl dgst -sha256 -verify {pubkey file} -signature {signature file} message.txt` 
  - You will see `Verified OK`!

### Notes

* In this demo, parties use browser's [LocalStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) to emulate p2p communications.
* It uses [prime256v1 (secp256r1)](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5480.txt) curve.
* It uses [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API) to generate [random](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto/getRandomValues) values, calculate [sha256](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto/digest) hashes.
* It's tested only on Chrome.

## Protocols

MPC ECDSA key generation / signing protocols consits of sub MPC protocols.

See [protcols page](./docs/protocols.md) for more details.

## Development

### Setup

```bash
yarn install
```

### Test

```bash
yarn run test
```

### Serve

```
yarn serve
```

This command runs a local http server, and builds asserts if there are changes on the code. Open `http://localhost:9000/demo.html` for demos.

### Build

```bash
yarn run build
```

This command generates assets under `dist` dir.
